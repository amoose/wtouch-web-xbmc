Known Limitation:
- Cover Art/Thumbnail of the Now Playing image is not resizable. So if your Cover Art/Thumbnail of media is too big or too small it may inconvenience shown in wTouch.
- Displayed current time may not actual time, but it synced for every 15 seconds. So between the time the time may not shown correctly.
- As I'm using default images from poc web in XBMC, the images may not fit well, as the default poc web is use black background, while the Browse Media of wTouch use white background.
